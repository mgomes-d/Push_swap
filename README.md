This project challenged me to sort data efficiently using stacks and a limited set of operations in C. It reinforced algorithmic thinking, complexity analysis, and low-level manipulation of data structures, while emphasizing performance optimization.

Approach & main achievements

    • Developed a C program push_swap to sort integers in stack a using stack b and a minimal set of operations (sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr)
    • Focused on finding the shortest sequence of instructions to sort a given set of integers
    • Managed error handling for invalid input, duplicates, and integer limits
    • Created a Makefile according to 42 Norm, with targets: all, clean, fclean, re
    • Implemented memory-safe code with proper malloc and free usage
    • Conducted benchmarks to validate efficiency:
        ◦ Sort 100 numbers in <700 operations (max for 100% validation)
        ◦ Sort 500 numbers in <5500 operations (max for 100% validation)

Technical environment & methodologies

    • C programming (low-level data structure manipulation)
    • Stack-based algorithmic sorting with minimal operations
    • Error handling and input validation
    • Memory management and dynamic allocation
    • Performance benchmarking and optimization
    • Makefile creation and project structuring according to 42 Norm
